1. Here this is a mainly todo app But with also a app with timer to see API response to see how the timer is working set application in 3g wil workn on optimization later.
2. Add redux store for better state management will work on it later for RTK Querty & also the DataFetcher.js
3. Add @reduxjs/toolkit libary & optimize the code although some of the older code remains as it is.
4. Do few improvments like added a new state to manage the checkbox non-clickable when editing the todo & also create a butoon Get Todo when we click it we get todo from one endpoint basically I used extraReducers & axios to manage that, And also make the original container a little bigger.
